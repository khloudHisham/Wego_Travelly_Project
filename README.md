# Wego_Travelly_Project

A web application built to offer a seamless booking experience similar to Wego.
Our app allows users to book flights and rooms, with rooms managed by an admin and later extendable to a "host" role for additional listings.
This project was collaboratively developed by a team of six ASP.Net developers.


### Installation

To set up the project locally:

1. **Clone the repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/khloudHisham/Wego_Travelly_Project
   cd Wego-ITI-final-project
   ```

2. **Backend Setup**:

   - Navigate to the backend folder and open the ASP.NET solution.
   - Update the necessary configurations (see [Configuration](#configuration) below).
   - Restore dependencies:

     ```bash
     cd backend
     dotnet restore
     ```

   - Create the first migration after setting up your DbContext and models:

     ```bash
     Add-Migration InitialCreate
     ```

   - Update the database with the new migration:

     ```bash
     Update-Database
     ```

   - Run the API project.

     ```bash
     dotnet run --project api
     ```

3. **Frontend Setup**:

   - Go to the frontend folder, install dependencies, and start the Angular development server.

     ```bash
     cd frontend
     npm install
     ng serve
     ```

### Project Structure

The project is organized into two main folders: `backend` and `frontend`.

#### Backend (ASP.NET Solution with 3 Projects)

1. **API Project**:

   - Contains controllers, mappers, DTOs, and required API folders and files.
   - Configured with JWT for authentication and Stripe for payment processing.

2. **Data Layer**:

   - Includes Unit of Work, repositories, context, and entities for data handling.

3. **Business Layer**:
   - Services and helper classes for image uploads , Payment service and email notifications.
   - **ImageHelper** handles server-side image storage.
   - **PaymentService** For Payment Session Creation.
   - **EmailService** sends emails; credentials must be configured (see [Configuration](#configuration)).

#### Frontend (Angular 18)

1. **App Structure**:

   - `core`: Contains reusable components like `header`, `nav`, and `footer`.
   - `dashboard`: Admin dashboard with controls for managing listings.
   - `main`: Pages for booking flights, room listings, and user account management (login, bookings, etc.).

2. **Folder Organization**:
   - `_models`, `_services`, `_guards`, and `__interceptors` are structured to maintain code modularity and separation of concerns.

- **Stripe Webhook**: Set up a webhook in Stripe for the checkout.session.completed event to process completed payment sessions.
- **Stripe Webhook**: Set up a webhook in Stripe for the checkout.session.completed event to process completed payment sessions.
- **Email Credentials**: Configure the email and password in the `EmailService` class for sending notifications.
